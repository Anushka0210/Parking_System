## Introduction
The Parking System is a console-based application developed to simulate the operations of a parking lot. It allows users to manage parking spaces, vehicles, and financial transactions associated with parking. The system provides an efficient and organized way to handle parking operations.

## Features
The parking system includes the following features:

- Vehicle entry and exit management
- Parking space allocation and deallocation
- Different vehicle types (car, motorcycle, etc.)
- Time-based parking fee calculation
- Availability status of parking spaces
- Parking fee collection and receipt generation
- Basic reporting and statistics

## Technologies Used
The parking system is developed using the following technologies:

- Java 11
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Data structures and algorithms
- Console input/output (I/O)
- Design patterns (e.g., Factory, Singleton)
- Gradle build system (optional)
- JUnit for unit testing (optional)

## Installation
To use the parking system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/parking-system.git
   ```

2. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

3. Build the project to compile the source code.

4. Run the application by executing the main class.

## Usage
Once the parking system is running, you can use the following commands to interact with the system:

- `park <vehicle_type> <vehicle_number>`: Parks a vehicle of the specified type with the given number.
- `exit <vehicle_number>`: Signals the exit of a vehicle with the provided number from the parking lot.
- `status`: Displays the current status of the parking lot, including the occupied and available spaces.
- `report`: Generates a report with statistics such as total parking revenue, number of vehicles parked, etc.
- `help`: Displays the list of available commands and their descriptions.
- `quit`: Exits the parking system.

Follow the on-screen instructions and input the required information when prompted.
